A blog project that started at 3am, what could go wrong? Originally forked from
[Gatsby's blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

## Launch

To run locally and isolated, run `docker-compose up --build` on
the root on the project. Then open http://localhost:8000
on your browser.
