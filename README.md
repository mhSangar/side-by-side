A blog project that started at 3am, what could go wrong? Originally forked from 
[Gatsby's blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

## Launch

To run locally and isolated, just run `docker-compose up --build` on 
the root on the project. Then open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
on your browser.
