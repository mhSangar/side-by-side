Have you ever think about having your own blog? For me, it has been a lot of times. I usually read DEV posts on my phone while I go to my job or going to the University. And everytime I think: "I would really like to share my ideas and my progress somewhere, so when I look back, I can see everything I have accomplished".

Last weekend, I finally got some time and I read [the awesome tutorial of Dave Ceddia][1]. Your own blog, using Gatsby (heard of it a lot recently!) and deployed somewhere everyone can check? In **less than 10 minutes**? 

It looked very good, but I wanted to give it a twist:

Everything looked so easy. So I complicated it a bit... ðŸ˜…

>What if I containerize it...

It's a normal day. You go to work and, in the train, you open 
the DEV app on your phone. You see how many people 
have the time to write a post, and how they enjoy doing it. 
You have been thinking about it for some time, but you didn't 
see it as clear as now. You take a decission.
