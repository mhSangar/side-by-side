It's a normal day. You go to work and, in the train, you open 
the DEV app on your phone. You see how many people 
have the time to write a post, and how they enjoy doing it. 
You have been thinking about it for some time, but you didn't 
see it as clear as now. You take a decission. 

>I am going to write my first post.
